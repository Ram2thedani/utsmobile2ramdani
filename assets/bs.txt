Strygwyr the Bloodseeker is a blood rite hunter, a vicious hunter of his faith that was ritually bound by the Blood Oath. He is but one of the many known as "Those Who Ever-Thirst" who faithfully serve the Flayed Twins, a pair of unstoppable deities who can only be pacified by blood to stave their vicious thirst.
Granted by his gods the energy of a ferocious hound and the power to wield his patrons' divine blood, this dogged yet spiritual hunter descends from the lofty peaks of Xhacatocatl with one goal in mind: to search for those willing and unwilling and release the gift of life that flows within their bodies.
